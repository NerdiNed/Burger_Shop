# Burger_Shop
First attempt to make a full project. Trying to connect what I am learning on the backend on a simulation of "real-life" project. 

This project has a lot of comments. Please keep in mind that I am a junior and it helps me to keep track of what I am doing and my thought steps. 
I also keep commented Code-blocks for learning purposes when I go back. 

Using a colorlib template on the frontend. Trying to connect the backend functionalities with it. 
Using NodeJs and Express for the backend and npm ejs
Trying to use an email sender, sessions and cookies. 

Start the project with : nodemon app.js
Port is listening on 4200
